The project is titled \"Market Segmentation: Identifying the Ideal Customer for Electric Vehicles in India.\"\n\nTarget:\nThe aim was to identify distinct buyer segments using psychographic, behavioral, and socio-economic characteristics through the 'perceived benefits-attitude-intention' framework. This segmentation is essential for effectively promoting EV adoption in emerging markets.\n\nSignificance:\nMarket segmentation is crucial for advancing EV adoption in emerging markets. The identified segments provide valuable insights for shaping policies, strategies, and marketing efforts to accelerate the transition towards electric mobility.\n\nResults:\nThrough our analysis, we identified three distinct sets of young consumer groups labeled as ‘Conservatives,’ ‘Indifferents,’ and ‘Enthusiasts,’ which are deemed to be budding EV buyers. These segments offer valuable guidance for scholars and policymakers to encourage EV adoption in the backdrop of an emerging sustainable transport market.\n\nWith this project, I have successfully completed my internship as a Machine Learning Intern at Feynn Labs. I would like to thank our guide, Mr. Sanjay Basumatary, for this amazing opportunity. Additionally, I extend my gratitude to my peers Nithya Johny,Sri Deekshith Labb and Rishita Pitta \nfor their valuable feedback and suggestions.\n\nHere's the link to my project:\nhttps://lnkd.in/dVmA42SK\n\n\nhashtag\n#marketanalysis \nhashtag\n#customersegmentation \nhashtag\n#dataanalysis \nhashtag\n#machinelearning \nhashtag\n#datascience \nhashtag\n#electricvehicles \nhashtag\n#EVs \nhashtag\n#FeynnLabs \nhashtag\n#internship\n…more\nGitHub - ShraddhaAlhat/EV-Market-Segmentation\ngithub.com\n14\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n844 impressions\nView analytics",
